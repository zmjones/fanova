  X,
  f,
  weights = NULL,
  max_order = 2L,

\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix or data frame of features (n x p).}

\item{f}{A numeric vector of responses, or a function that takes X and returns a numeric vector.}

\item{weights}{Optional numeric vector of weights for each observation.}

\item{max_order}{The maximum interaction order to include (e.g., 2 for main effects and pairwise interactions).}

\item{df1}{The number of spline basis functions for each univariate main effect.}

\item{degree}{The degree of the splines.}

\item{include}{An optional list of integer vectors specifying the exact interaction sets to include.}
}
\value{
An object of class 'fanova'.
}
\description{
Decomposes a function f(x) into a hierarchically orthogonal, ANOVA-like
representation of main effects and interactions.
